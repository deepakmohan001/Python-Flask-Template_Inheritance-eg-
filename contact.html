<h1>Contact Page</h1>
<h3><p>The contact page should be simple and user-friendly, providing multiple ways for customers to reach your support team. At the top, include a brief welcome message, like “We’re here to help! Reach out to us with any questions or feedback.” Below, list your contact details: a customer service email, phone number, and mailing address. Include a Contact Form with fields for the customer’s name, email, order number, and message. Add an FAQ section addressing common queries (e.g., shipping, returns). Display your customer service hours and a live chat option for immediate assistance. Social media links can also be included for additional contact options.</p></h3>
